# Hecla_Hoek_Supergroup_Svalbard_d13C_d18O_data_Neoproterozoic_Ordovician

This GitHub repository contains the d13C and d18O data published within Millikin, A.E., Gibson, T.M., Strauss, J.V., Bergmann, K.D., Tosca, N.J., Anderson, R.P., Halverson, G.P., Zhang, T. and Rooney, A.D., 2025. Geochemistry and mineralogy of Neoproterozoic strata in northeastern Svalbard: Reevaluating the prevalence of basalt weathering during the early Neoproterozoic. Geological Society of America Bulletin.

This repository contains data and supporting materials for Neoproterozoic, Cambrian, and Ordovician carbonate strata in Ny Friesland and Nordaustlandet. Samples were collected over three field seasons (2014, 2016, and 2017) and were cut and drilled at MIT before analysis.  Physical samples reside at MIT.  

This repository includes:

data/: Contains raw datasets for stratigraphic columns, GPS points and metadata for all sections, raw and processed d13C and d18O isotopic analyses from the MIT Carbonate Research Laboratory Nu Perspective IRMS.

data/

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
